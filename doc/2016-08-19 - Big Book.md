WHO cares to admit complete defeat?  Practically no one, of course.  Every natural instinct cries out against the idea of personal powerlessness.  It is truly awful to admit that  --eyes drawn to a display, a million tiny flashlights commiting information on our brain-- we have warped our minds into such an obsession for destructive programming that only an act of `providence` can remove it from us.

[1]  `bounded` defined on nLab in context: `functional analysis`, `bornological set`, `bounded set` and `boundary`, see [bounded](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/search?query=bounded).  A real world intuition for the term, manifested from an object point of view can be found on wikipedia as "the particle has a tendency to remain localised in one or more regions of space", see [bound state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state) quoted in 2016.
