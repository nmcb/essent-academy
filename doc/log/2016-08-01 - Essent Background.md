Amice,

I'm about to sent the following e-mail to all development teams.

As I'm signing in name of IPay3 and would like to have consensus on the content.

Please confirm your approval.

Regards,

Marco

PS.  Team effort :) https://xkcd.com/1543/

Amice,

Two weeks ago the Essent IPay3 development team discussed the current size of the codebase [1] in relation to its maintainability upon completion of the project as asserted from an Essent credit system functionality point of view.  Present were Peter Aker, Marcel Heijmans, Reinier Bos and the undersigned thus representing the management-, architectural- and development-disciplines of both Essent's and Powerhouse's credit codebases.  The context of the discussion was the duration of active development of the total project and related to an external evaluation of the current codebase which occurred beginning 2016; the latter evaluation resulted in the advise to fully rebuild the system.  The following was agreed upon:

a)  Investment of one sprint amount of teamwork in a credit sub-system proving maintainability.
b)  Enabling collaboration through knowledge sharing between teams.

We, developers of the Essent IPay3 credit team, would like to start ASAP and see possibility to do so collaborating on the second agreement  --this as we are currently awaiting clearance of resources for the creation of the team developing the sub-system while we are finalising the functional scope of the MT940 interface, i.e. the sub-system that will be rebuild; we will structurally invest time in a system theory workshop, were we work on the architectural rules constraining the future codebase of Essent's credit system, weekly every Thursday from 17:00 till 20:00 and for the remainder and duration of the project.  We welcome workshop participation by developers from other teams.  We respectfully and humbly ask you to RSVP for the first workshop which will take place on 2016-08-04, tomorrow.

With regards and much love,

Marco Borst in name of the IPay3 development team.

[1]  The current system architecture does not allow for the factorisation of the credit domain into a separate codebase module, but is assumed to be approximately 33% (one third) of the total amount of required functionality.  Essent's infinity codebase currently comprises 1.5M sloc.  We estimate 75K sloc reasonable for the credit functionality part, argumented for after carefully comparing the current implementation against similar systems though then implemented with the current state of industry proven technology, the latter statement observable and provably operational in comparable markets.
