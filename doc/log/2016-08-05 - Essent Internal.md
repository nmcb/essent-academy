Team,

I think it correct to update you on the follow-up after our e-mail to developers from both Essent and Powerhouse, the one intended to invest in point (b) "Enabling collaboration through knowledge sharing between teams", the one for which we agreed to invest in terms of multiple months, estimated six, to organise a course;  functional programming in scala.  We intended the course to be offered outside working hours, organised by developers (me mostly, with perhaps your help in a later stage) for developers, and with no impact on the functional or management disciplines at all.  Most of the communication and e-mail was handled by me.  I had a follow-up discussion with Peter.  The current state of affairs concerning the organisation of this course is:

1.  Peter made it clear that (for now) no program budget will be invested in point (a) the investment of one sprint amount of teamwork in a credit sub-system proving maintainability.  This is unfortunate, firstly because I already communicated to you the possibility that you could be part of this team, secondly because IMHO it is the wrong decision from a technology management point of view.  I appologise for any expectations I may have caused during this communicational fuckup.  I do my best, but seem to communicate badly.

2.  Peter also made it clear that Laura was not aware and perhaps even angry or not ammused to receive my (our) mail without prior knowledge of our investment.  Laura, again and this time not in cc of this email, but as an official addressee, a part of the team (!):  My (our) apologies.  I (we) will keep you better informed in the near future.  Lets sit together and talk, I believe it beneficial if not necessary.

3.  Peter also made it clear that team size will be reduced in the near future, and this is the point I have the most issues with, firstly because of my promise to you to "carry and drive" the workshop during the first 6 months.  I cannot longer keep my promise and commitment on because of his decision and feel ashamed because I know that you were looking forward to collaborate in- and learn from the workshop.  I am able to lower my commitment to "carry and drive" the workshop to a period of 2 months though, should I be part of the reduction the possibly of working abroad starting October would be very real.  Given such future situation I would be unable to be in Amsterdam on a weekly basis even during my free time.  I believe it beneficial for your professional future lives, so I would suggest to go ahead as planned but now for the scope of two months.

Regards,

Marco Borst

Team,

I think it correct to update you on the fallout after our e-mail to developers from both Essent and Powerhouse, the one intended to invest in point (b) "Enabling collaboration through knowledge sharing between teams", the one for which we agreed to invest in terms of multiple months, estimated six, to organise a course;  functional programming in scala.  We intended the course to be offered outside working hours, organised by developers (me mostly, with perhaps your help in a later stage) for developers, and with no impact on the functional or management disciplines at all.  Most of the communication and e-mail was handled by me.  There was fallout.  The current state of affairs concerning the organisation of this course is:

1.  Peter made it clear that neither time nor money will be invested in point (a) the investment of one sprint amount of teamwork in a credit sub-system proving maintainability.  This is unfortunate, firstly because I already communicated to you the possibility that you could be part of this team, secondly because it is the wrong decision from a technology management point of view.  I appologise for any expectations I may have caused during this communicational fuckup.  I do my best, but seem to communicate badly.

2.  Peter also made it clear that Laura was "not amused" and perhaps even angry or disappointed to receive my (our) mail without prior knowledge of our investment.  Laura, again and this time not in cc of this email, but as an official addressee, a part of the team (!):  My (our) apologies.  I (we) will keep you better informed in the near future.  Lets sit together and talk, I believe it beneficial if not necessary.

3.  Peter also made it clear that team developer size will be reduced in the near future, and this is the point I have the most issues with, firstly because of my promise to you to "carry and drive" the workshop during the first 6 months.  I cannot longer keep my promise and commitment on because of his decision and feel ashamed because I know that you were looking forward to collaborate in- and learn from the workshop.  I am able to lower my commitment to "carry and drive" the workshop to a period of 2 months though, should I be part of the reduction the possibly of working abroad starting October would be very real.  Given such future situation I would be unable to be in Amsterdam on a weekly basis even during my free time.  I believe it beneficial for your professional future lives, so I would suggest to go ahead as planned but now for the scope of two months.

4.  Lastly, Peter made it clear that free time starts at 6 o'clock.
