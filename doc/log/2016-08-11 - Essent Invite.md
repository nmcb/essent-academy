Mes frères et sœurs,

Last week we introduced the start of a workshop system theory, hoping for participation by developers from other teams.  The first one will take place on 2016-08-11, Thursday this week, from 18:00 till 21:00 and will be introductionary as well as set scope and goals for subsequent workshops.  As we did not receive a lot of developer response, if you still plan to join, let me know!  We'll meet at HNK Amsterdam Houthavens tomorrow at 18:00, have some dinner and then engage into making programming fun again.

Much love,

Marco Borst in name of the IPay2/3 development team.

PS.  Please note that time and effort expenditure will be required, but on an private, professional developer basis.  (This since the initiative is not financially sponsered by Essent, nor by Powerhouse.)  Time spend will be your own investment, we estimate a total of 6 hours of time required per developer per week.
