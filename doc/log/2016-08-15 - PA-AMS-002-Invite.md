Dear Programmers, Beautiful Beings and Providers of Energy, Knowledge and Wisdom,

Just a quick reminder beforehand;  The 2nd workshop system theory will be tonight from 18:00 till 21:00, we'll meet at HNK in the central hall.  Last week we discussed scope and goals for subsequent workshops and decided on the following three subjects and study material:

- Sound Communication, i.e. employing http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0133846830
- Sound Functionality, i.e. employing http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1617290653
- Sound Quality,       i.e. employing http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0932633226

We follow a serial process studying these subjects and at the beginning of tonight's workshop we'll choose our first subject and dive in deeply and directly.  So, for any of you crazy programmers out there who want to have a bit of control and influence due to a personal preference for, or interest in, one of these subjects,... be sure to be on time, as the subject chosen will very much influence the context of this and the next couple of subsequent workshops [1,2].

Much love and see you tonight,

Marco Borst in name of the IPay2/3 development team.

PS.  As a reminder: please note that a personal expenditure time and effort will be required, as can be expected by any professional developer.  Time spend will be your own investment, we estimate a total of 6 hours of study required per developer per week.  Also note that we will mainly look at, discuss, and write code.  An affinity with functional programming languages or a developer mindset and feeling for quality, management, communication and commitment may be required in order to fully appreciate, indeed benefit from, this workshop.
