## Notes

[1] With `sound` is meant the opposite of `unsound`; 2. "not
    based on sound or reliable evidence or reasoning" [a],
    OED 2016.  With `functionality`, the art of programming
    functionally.

    [a] Double-quotes, i.e `"`, are to be taken as communicated
        literaly, in which case an attribution and context is to
        be provided.  Note: they are (almost) always safe to be
        interpreted and evaluated as the communication of fear.

[2] FPS is short for Functional Programming in Scala, for
    pragmatic and professional reasons we will follow Paul
    Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason's book to structure the
    workshop's schedule.

[4] Back-ticks, i.e. `\``, are ment literally, or when one wants
    to communicate the sense that the word is valid both in the
    manifest image, as well as the scientific image, but they should
    be interpreted and evaluated (and aggreed upon!) as the commun-
    ication of their scientific semantics.
