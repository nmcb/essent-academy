друзья,

Our 3rd workshop will take place on Wednesday, Amsterdam.  The usual time and the usual place.  We decided on Sound Functionality as subject, following the FPS book we'll discuss chapter 1 & 2 and the exercises of chapter 2.  Make sure you reply with your github account so that you can be added as collaborator, access the exercises in code, follow discussions, etc & etc.  We welcome all.

Much love and see you next week,

Marco Borst in name of the IPay2/3 development team.

PS.  As a reminder: please note that a personal expenditure of time and effort will be required, time spend will be your own investment, we estimate a total of 6 hours of study required per programmer per week.  Also note that we will mainly look at, discuss, and write code.  An affinity with functional programming languages or a programmer mindset and feeling for quality, management, communication and commitment may be required in order to fully appreciate, indeed benefit from, this workshop.
