Ola,

Just a quick reminder;  The 4th workshop system theory will be Thursday
September the 1st from 18:00 till 21:00, we'll meet at HNK in the central
hall.  Last week we had some miscommunication, nobody presided and nobody
attended.  Too bad, mistakes happen, we learn from them and we move on.

Notes are available on github as usual, make sure you share your account
name so that you can contribute and reap the benefits of similar minded
spirits.  Let's make programming fun again.

Much love and see you on Thursday,

Marco Borst in name of the IPay2/3 development team.

PS.  As a reminder: please note that a personal expenditure time and
effort will be required, as can be expected by any professional developer.
Time spend will be your own investment, we estimate a total of 6 hours of
study required per developer per week.  Also note that we will mainly look
at, discuss, and write code.  An affinity with functional programming lang-
uages or a developer mindset and feeling for quality, management, communi-
cation and commitment may be required in order to fully appreciate, indeed
benefit from, this workshop.
