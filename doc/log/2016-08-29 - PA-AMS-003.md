### Present

None.

### Opening

N.a.

### Questions (5 min)

Q: How is it possible no one presided this meeting ?

### Statements (5 min)

A: If it is important to us, we will find a way.

### Study

Additional exercise; implement the sqrt function:

  sqrt(y)  := { âˆƒ x | f(x) = x^2 - y = 0 }

Employing Newton's law for finding roots:

  x[n+1] = x[n] - f(x[n]) / f'(x[n])

Which simplifies to:

  sqrt(y)  :=  x[n+1] = 0.5 * ( x[n] + y / x[n] )

## Planning

The next workshop will be Thursday 2016-09-01 18:00-21:00.
