## PA 2016-09-01 Amsterdam HNK [18:00-21:00]

Present: Marcel, Martijn, Marco

### Opening

We read Step 1 from the Big Book.

### Questions (5 min)

- What is a lie ?

### Statements (5 min)

- A statement is not a question.
- Meaning is relative to context.
- What is true cannot be false and what is false cannot be true but what is not true is always false while what is not false is not neccesarily true.

### Study

We studied the exercises of [chapter 2](https://github.com/nmcb/essent-academy/blob/master/src/ExercisesChapter02.sc).  Notably a discussion to rename `prev` to `curr` in the fibonacci exercise, as current and next reflect best the sliding window of the sequence in a recursive call, particularly expression wise.  That is when the `n > 0` case, which expresses an itteration calculates the future current by adding the current current and current previous values, and by letting the future previous be the current current.  Other notable discussions considered infinity in relation to types, types being defined as a `Set` of values, which in practice is `bounded` if implemented on physical hardware.  Integer values for example, _will_ overflow under addition and multiplication as the set of all integers is unbounded.  Inspiration for some of this more phylisophically inclined discussion was provided by Bartosz Milewski, see the media section below for more.  More pragmatically, we spent some time discussing the Scala simple build tool, or `sbt`, the Scala Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, or `repl`  (both the default scala as well as the ammonite repl were discussed)  and we compared coding Scala in Intellij versus the repl.  From a functional point of view we discussed functions versus function values; function types, function application and function composition.

## Planning

The next workshop will be Thursday 2016-09-08 18:00-21:00.

And, will be presided by Marcel as Marco will attend Scala World that week.
