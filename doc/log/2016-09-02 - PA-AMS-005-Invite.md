## PA 2016-09-02 Amsterdam HNK [18:00-21:00]

Present: Marcel, Martijn, Marco

### Opening

We read Step 1 from the Big Book.

### Questions (5 min)

- What is a lie ?

### Statements (5 min)

- A statement is not a question.
- Meaning is relative to context.

### Study

We studied the exercises of [chapter 2](goo.gl/7Bp6j1).

Notably there was a discussion to rename `prev` to `curr` in the fibonacci exercise, as current and next reflect best the sliding window of the sequence in a recursive call, particularly expression wise, as can be seen in the `n > 0` case, which expresses the tail call at which instant the future current is being calculated by adding the current current and current previous values, and by letting the future previous be the current current.

Other notable discussions considered infinity in relation to types, types being defined as a `Set` of values, which in practice is `bounded` if implemented on physical hardware, i.e. a turing machine.  Integer values as defined abstractly for example, _will_ overflow in reality under addition and multiplication as the set of all integers is unbounded even though each element, each number, is provably `countable`.  Inspiration for some of this more philosophically inclined discussion was provided by Bartosz Milewski, see the media section below for more.

More pragmatically, we spent some time discussing the Scala simple build tool, or `sbt`, the Scala Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, or `repl`, both the default scala as well as the ammonite repl were discussed.  Also we compared coding Scala in Intellij versus coding in the repl.  From a functional point of view we discussed functions versus function values and how Scala's `_` operator provides access to function values; we discussed function types being a superset of data types;  we discussed function application and function value application having the same semantics in Scala;  and we discussed function composition.

## Planning

The next workshop will be Thursday 2016-09-08 18:00-21:00.

And, will be presided by Marcel as Marco will attend Scala World that week.

## Notes

As an after thought to the questions we submit the statements that true is what exists.  What is true cannot be false and what is false cannot be true, or, what exist cannot not exist and what does not exist cannot exist.  What is not true must be false, false being defined as that what does not exist.  But what is not false on the other hand, is not neccesarily true.  We cannot derive what exist from that what does not exist, we can only observe what exists and therefor observe what is true.  Or in the words of a dead philosopher with a German sounding name:  "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent."
