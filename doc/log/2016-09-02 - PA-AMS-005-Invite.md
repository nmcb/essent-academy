Ola,

The 5th workshop system theory will be Thursday September 8 from 18:00
till 21:00, we'll meet at HNK in the central hall, Marcel will preside
as Marco will be attending Scala World next week.

The minutes of workshop 4 can be found in the repo, make sure you share
your account name so that you can contribute while reaping the benefits
of similar minded spirits at the same time.  It's not that we are free
to do otherwise, since nature, in its infinite wisdom, choose to make
instantanious and bi-directional communication a scarce resource.

Being human and bound to communicate, we are left with no other choice
then to be either silent or lie in order to stay as honest to others as
we are to ourselves.  Fortunately, at least we are free to choose the
environment in which we can balance contributions and reciprocals.  The
alternative, forever be doomded to be silent or lying to others while
spending trying to come up with reasons why, nontheless, we are ere not
to blame.

Much love and see you on Thursday,

Marco Borst in name of the IPay2/3 development team.

PS.  As a reminder: please note that a personal expenditure time and
effort will be required, as can be expected by any professional developer.
Time spend will be your own investment, we estimate a total of 6 hours of
study required per developer per week.  Also note that we will mainly look
at, discuss, and write code.  An affinity with functional programming lang-
uages or a developer mindset and feeling for quality, management, communi-
cation and commitment may be required in order to fully appreciate, indeed
benefit from, this workshop.
