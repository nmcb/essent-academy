Ola,

The 5th workshop system theory will be Thursday September 8 from 18:00 till 21:00, we'll meet at HNK in the central hall, Marcel will preside as Marco will be attending Scala World next week.

The minutes of workshop 4 can be found in the repo.  [goo.gl/YHWtO4]  Note that the project has been renamed to Programmers Anonymous, as we want to reflect independence from the organism Essent.  Make sure you share your account name so that you can contribute while reaping the benefits of similar minded spirits at the same time.  [1]

Much love and see you on Thursday,

Marco Borst in name Programmers Anonymous (PA-AMS).

[1]  It's not that we are free to do otherwise, as Nature, in its infinite wisdom, choose to make instantanious and bi-directional communication a scarce resource.  Being human and bound to communicate, we, provided we find honesty towards others as important as honesty towards ourself, are left with no other choice then to be either silent or lie.  Fortunately, at least we are free to choose the environment in which we can balance contributions and reciprocals while communicating.  The alternative, being doomed to lie to others while trying to come up with reasons why we, nontheless, are not to blame, is worse.  Forced to communicate, we better be silent.


PS.   As a reminder: please note that personal expenditure of time and effort will be required. Time spend will be your own investment, we estimate a total of 6 hours of study required per developer per week.  Also note that we will mainly look at, discuss, and write code.  An affinity with functional programming languages and/or a developer mindset and feeling for quality, management, communication and commitment may be required in order to fully appreciate, indeed benefit from, this workshop.
